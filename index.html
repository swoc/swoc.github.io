            <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello reader! Nice of you to drop by.</p>
                <p>My name is Andres. I was born in 1990 in Estonia where I mostly live to date.</p>
                <p>I got my first computer in 1997, soon after that I started coding – my first experiments were done with Pascal, VBS, HTML. After I had built a few games in Pascal, I discovered Game Maker and managed to put together a few games with that program as well.</p>
                <p>For some reason I stopped working with games and went back to web design – after we got a dial-up connection at home, I started using IRC and the kind people on the internet suggested looking into PHP, which I did. At first, it didn't make any sense, but slowly I started to get along with it better.</p>
                <p>At this point in my life my mom ordered me to spend less time sitting behind screens and suggested me to go play outside instead – so my programming adventures and relations with computers were put on hold for a while.</p>
                <p>Instead of going outside I spent my time tinkering with electronics. Soon after that I decided to look into PICs – that meant programming in ASM (my first ever PIC project was a 3x3x3 LED cube). As I realised that I in fact hated ASM, I went along and bought my first AVR and started coding in Embedded C and C++.</p>
                <p>That somehow got me interested in this field and I started learning new things – as soon as I brought my first ever Android phone (Xperia Arc S (L18i)) I picked up Java – as it looked horrible to me at that time, I decided to do all my software developing in Python and C.</p>
                <p>Embedded systems, Robotics and Electronics are subjects I am deeply enthralled with to this day. I have built custom electric solutions for several rally cars, developed my own tachometer and instrument panel, and built many educational / testing devices for the Estonian University of Life Sciences and more. I even started the robotics club in the Estonian University of Life Sciences.</p>
                <p>As you may see I am a guy with many talents: I am strong-willed – if I don't know something yet, I'll look it up and learn it. I am persistent – if I am into something, I will stick it out till the end. I will not quit – I still have some projects even from my childhood that are “haunting” me because I could not solve / build them as good as I would have liked to back then, and so I rebuild / rediscover projects and things from time to time and try to make them perfect.</p>
                <p>Sidenote - it all started from computer games and aside of playing some every once in a while, I still do have my own computer games projects.</p>

                            I'm really into growing my own food - that's why some years ago I picked up hydroponics.
                            I would also like to try aquaponics, but I have room issues.
                            I also grow microgreens.

                            I am a licenced B class HAM radio operator - you can hear me anywhere from 160m to 70cm.
                            This means that I have a lot of big antennas and towers to send radio signals to the other side
                            of the Earth or listen to satellites on orbit or bounce my radio signals from Moon to reach farther places on shorter wavelengths.

                            Since I grew up in the countryside and didn't have much money - if something broke, I had to fix it.
                            If I wanted something new, I had to build it from scratch.
                            This means that today I have a homemade 3d printer, homemade Arduino copies etc.
                            I tend to do as much as I can myself as long there is a learning aspect, or it's much cheaper this way.

                            I have been automating things since my early childhood - first project was to close the curtains of my windows automatically.
                            Then I made a band out of old floppy disk stepper motors.
                            Homemade plotters ... this list goes on.
                            <br>
                            Also the previously mentioned 3d printer falls into this category.
                            My latest creation is a 3d antenna rotator with software - I can just tell the rotator what planet / star / galaxy / satellite I want
                            to track and the rotator knows where to turn and how to track this object.
